## User Story

```md
AS A BootCamp student
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks and homework I need to complete
```
##
My assignment was to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end was already created. It was my job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Render.
